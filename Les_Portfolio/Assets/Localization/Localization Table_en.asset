    m_Localized: "hello. My name is Euisu Lee, a Unity client developer.\r\nAt first,
      I worked in the electrical/electronics industry for about 3 years. Then, for
      my future and goals, I attended Unity Game Development Academy for a year and
      got a job as a Unity client as a non-major. It has already been 3 years.\r\nThe
      reason I set my sights on becoming a game developer is because I like games
      (I especially like Japanese games a lot).\r\nIt was because I wanted to see
      someone on the street getting angry, sad, or happy while playing the game I
      made, and I wanted to play the game myself.\r\nHowever, when I was working,
      Metaverse was very popular in the job market, so I got a job to improve my
      development skills.\r\nThe first company I worked at as a developer was developing
      SI and educational applications.\r\nMy first job at that company was to develop
      a Metaverse like \u2018Kidstopia\u2019 where children could learn while playing.\r\nAs
      I was the first Unity developer to join the company, I did not know network
      integration and had no experience, so I remember working all night for three
      weeks.\r\nI developed it diligently for a year and learned Cinemachine, Network,
      Assetbundle, Particle System, and Webview.\r\nA year later, Sasu joined the
      company and learned UI structure, Addressable, Localization, Git, etc. and
      used them in development.\r\nAfter a year and a half, I left the company after
      hearing that Metaverse had completed its first phase of development and would
      soon be released.\r\nThere were many difficulties, hardships, and concerns
      due to frequent communication and collaboration with planners and designers
      during development, but I was very happy that we worked hard from the beginning
      to the completion of the first development.\r\nI often heard them say, \u2018Mr.
      Ui-su is very communicative and works hard to do what you ask of him.\u2019\r\nIn
      this way, I am positive and cheerful, and even when difficult things arise,
      I do not give up and work hard to explore, try, and move forward.\r\nI want
      to communicate with many people and develop really fun games together."
